Parallel vs distributed computing

How does parallel computing work? It either uses one machine with multiple processors, or lots of machines cooperating in a network. There are 3 distinct architectures.

    1) Shared memory parallel computers use multiple processors to access the same memory resources. Examples of shared memory parallel architecture are modern laptops, desktops, and smartphones.
    2) Distributed memory parallel computers use multiple processors, each with their own memory, connected over a network. Examples of distributed systems include cloud computing, distributed rendering of computer graphics, and shared resource systems like SETI [17].
    3) Hybrid memory parallel systems combine shared-memory parallel computers and distributed memory networks. Most “distributed memory” networks are actually hybrids. You may have thousands of desktops and laptops with multi-core processors all connected in a network and working on a massive problem.
